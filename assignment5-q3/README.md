## How AI Was Used

- The entire demoPlaces map—including all entries under “Museums”, “Parks”, and “Restaurants”—was generated by AI to quickly provide plausible Boston locations for demo/testing.

The id values (Int) were assigned arbitrarily/sequentially for convenience and do not correspond to any real database.

### Where AI Misunderstood Navigation

- Passed full objects through routes: Early drafts suggested sending entire place objects in the route. We corrected this to pass only category (String) and id (Int) and then look up details at the destination.
